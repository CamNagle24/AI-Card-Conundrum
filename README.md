## Setup

If you want to play around with the algorithms, feel free to clone my repo. To start, please enter the following commands on your terminal:

```
git clone https://github.com/CamNagle24/AI-Card-Conundrum
```

You can then go to the file in src -> student -> Tournament.java 
Then run that to see all the win rates for 10000 trials of each AI strategy.
